SCENE, Germany&mdash;Time of representation one day.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap01"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>
It would appear like affectation to offer an apology for any scenes or passages
omitted or added, in this play, different from the original: its reception has
given me confidence to suppose what I have done is right; for Kotzebue&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Child of Love&rdquo; in Germany, was never more attractive than
&ldquo;Lovers&rsquo; Vows&rdquo; has been in England.
</p>

<p>
I could trouble my reader with many pages to disclose the motives which induced
me to alter, with the exception of a few common-place sentences only, the
characters of Count Cassel, Amelia, and Verdun the Butler&mdash;I could explain
why the part of the Count, as in the original, would inevitably have condemned
the whole Play,&mdash;I could inform my reader why I have pourtrayed the Baron
in many particulars different from the German author, and carefully prepared
the audience for the grand effect of the last scene in the fourth act, by
totally changing his conduct towards his son as a robber&mdash;why I gave
sentences of a humourous kind to the parts of the two Cottagers&mdash;why I was
compelled, on many occasions, to compress the matter of a speech of three or
four pages into one of three or four lines&mdash;and why, in no one instance, I
would suffer my respect for Kotzebue to interfere with my profound respect for
the judgment of a British audience. But I flatter myself such a vindication is
not requisite to the enlightened reader, who, I trust, on comparing this drama
with the original, will at once see all my motives&mdash;and the dull admirer
of mere verbal translation, it would be vain to endeavour to inspire with taste
by instruction.
</p>

<p>
Wholly unacquainted with the German language, a literal translation of the
&ldquo;Child of Love&rdquo; was given to me by the manager of Covent Garden
Theatre to be fitted, as my opinion should direct, for his stage. This
translation, tedious and vapid as most literal translations are, had the
peculiar disadvantage of having been put into our language by a German&mdash;of
course it came to me in broken English. It was no slight misfortune to have an
example of bad grammar, false metaphors and similes, with all the usual errors
of feminine diction, placed before a female writer. But if, disdaining the
construction of sentences,&mdash;the precise decorum of the cold
grammarian,&mdash;she has caught the spirit of her author,&mdash;if, in every
altered scene,&mdash;still adhering to the nice propriety of his meaning, and
still keeping in view his great catastrophe,&mdash;she has agitated her
audience with all the various passions he depicted, the rigid criticism of the
closet will be but a slender abatement of the pleasure resulting from the
sanction of an applauding theatre.
</p>

<p>
It has not been one of the least gratifications I have received from the
success of this play, that the original German, from which it is taken, was
printed in the year 1791; and yet, that during all the period which has
intervened, no person of talents or literary knowledge (though there are in
this country many of that description, who profess to search for German dramas)
has thought it worth employment to make a translation of the work. I can only
account for such an apparent neglect of Kotzebue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Child of
Love,&rdquo; by the consideration of its original unfitness for an English
stage, and the difficulty of making it otherwise&mdash;a difficulty which once
appeared so formidable, that I seriously thought I must have declined it even
after I had proceeded some length in the undertaking.
</p>

<p>
Independently of objections to the character of the Count, the dangerous
insignificance of the Butler, in the original, embarrassed me much. I found, if
he was retained in the <i>Dramatis Personæ</i>, something more must be supplied
than the author had assigned him: I suggested the verses I have introduced; but
not being blessed with the Butler&rsquo;s happy art of rhyming, I am indebted
for them, except the seventh and eleventh stanzas in the first of his poetic
stories, to the author of the prologue.
</p>

<p>
The part of Amelia has been a very particular object of my solicitude and
alteration: the same situations which the author gave her remain, but almost
all the dialogue of the character I have changed: the forward and unequivocal
manner in which she announces her affection to her lover, in the original,
would have been revolting to an English audience: the passion of love,
represented on the stage, is certain to be insipid or disgusting, unless it
creates smiles or tears: Amelia&rsquo;s love, by Kotzebue, is indelicately
blunt, and yet void of mirth or sadness: I have endeavoured to attach the
attention and sympathy of the audience by whimsical insinuations, rather than
coarse abruptness&mdash;the same woman, I conceive, whom the author drew, with
the self-same sentiments, but with manners adapted to the English rather than
the German taste; and if the favour in which this character is held by the
audience, together with every sentence and incident which I have presumed to
introduce in the play, may be offered as the criterion of my skill, I am
sufficiently rewarded for the task I have performed.
</p>

<p>
In stating the foregoing circumstances relating to this production, I hope not
to be suspected of arrogating to my own exertions only, the popularity which
has attended &ldquo;The Child of Love,&rdquo; under the title of
&ldquo;Lovers&rsquo; Vows,&rdquo;&mdash;the exertions of every performer
engaged in the play deservedly claim a share in its success; and I must
sincerely thank them for the high importance of their aid.

<h2><a name="sceneI_0" id="sceneI_0"></a>PROLOGUE.</h2>

<p>
WRITTEN BY JOHN TAYLOR, ESQ.
</p>

<p>
<i>Spoken by Mr. MURRAY.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Poets have oft&rsquo; declared, in doleful strain,<br/>
That o&rsquo;er dramatic tracks they beat in vain,<br/>
Hopeless that novelty will spring to sight;<br/>
For life and nature are exhausted quite.<br/>
Though plaints like these have rung from age to age,<br/>
Too kind are writers to desert the stage;<br/>
And if they, fruitless, search for unknown prey,<br/>
At least they dress <i>old game</i> a <i>novel way</i>;<br/>
But such lamentings should be heard no more,<br/>
For modern taste turns Nature out of door;<br/>
Who ne&rsquo;er again her former sway will boast,<br/>
Till, to complete her works, <i>she starts a ghost</i>.<br/>
    If such the mode, what can we hope to-night,<br/>
Who rashly dare approach without a sprite?<br/>
No dreadful cavern, no midnight scream,<br/>
No rosin flames, nor e&rsquo;en one flitting gleam.<br/>
Nought of the charms so potent to invite<br/>
The monstrous charms of terrible delight.<br/>
Our present theme the German Muse supplies,<br/>
But rather aims to soften than surprise.<br/>
Yet, with her woes she strives some smiles to blend,<br/>
Intent as well to cheer as to amend:<br/>
On her own native soil she knows the art<br/>
To charm the fancy, and to touch the heart.<br/>
If, then, she mirth and pathos can express,<br/>
Though less engaging in an English dress,<br/>
Let her from British hearts no peril fear,<br/>
But, as a STRANGER*, find a welcome here.

<h3>SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>A high road, a town at a distance&mdash;A small inn on one side of
the road&mdash;A cottage on the other.</i>
</p>

<p class="center">
<i>The</i> LANDLORD <i>of the inn leads</i> AGATHA <i>by the hand out of his
house.</i>
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
No, no! no room for you any longer&mdash;It is the fair to-day in the next
village; as great a fair as any in the German dominions. The country people
with their wives and children take up every corner we have.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
You will turn a poor sick woman out of doors who has spent her last farthing in
your house.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
For that very reason; because she <i>has</i> spent her last farthing.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
I can work.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
You can hardly move your hands.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
My strength will come again.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
Then <i>you</i> may come again.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
What am I to do? Where shall I go?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
It is fine weather&mdash;you may go any where.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Who will give me a morsel of bread to satisfy my hunger?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
Sick people eat but little.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Hard, unfeeling man, have pity.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
When times are hard, pity is too expensive for a poor man. Ask alms of the
different people that go by.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Beg! I would rather starve.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
You may beg and starve too. What a fine lady you are! Many an honest woman has
been obliged to beg. Why should not you? [Agatha <i>sits down upon a large
stone under a tree.</i>] For instance, here comes somebody; and I will teach
you how to begin. [<i>A Countryman, with working tools, crosses the road.</i>]
Good day, neighbour Nicholas.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNTRYMAN<br/>
Good day. [<i>Stops.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
Won&rsquo;t you give a trifle to this poor woman? [<i>Countryman takes no
notice, but walks off.</i>] That would not do&mdash;the poor man has nothing
himself but what he gets by hard labour. Here comes a rich farmer; perhaps he
will give you something.
</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Enter</i> FARMER.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
Good morning to you, Sir. Under yon tree sits a poor woman in distress, who is
in need of your charity.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FARMER.<br/>
Is she not ashamed of herself? Why don&rsquo;t she work?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
She has had a fever.&mdash;If you would but pay for one dinner&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FARMER.<br/>
The harvest has been indifferent, and my cattle and sheep have suffered
distemper. [<i>Exit.</i>
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
My fat, smiling face was not made for begging: you&rsquo;ll have more luck with
your thin, sour one&mdash;so, I&rsquo;ll leave you to yourself. [<i>Exit.</i>
</p>

<p class="center">
[Agatha <i>rises and comes forward.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Oh Providence! thou hast till this hour protected me, and hast given me
fortitude not to despair. Receive my humble thanks, and restore me to health,
for the sake of my poor son, the innocent cause of my sufferings, and yet my
only comfort. [<i>kneeling</i>] Oh, grant that I may see him once more! See him
improved in strength of mind and body; and that by thy gracious mercy he may
never be visited with afflictions great as mine. [<i>After a pause</i>] Protect
his father too, merciful Providence, and pardon his crime of perjury to me!
Here, in the face of heaven (supposing my end approaching, and that I can but a
few days longer struggle with want and sorrow), here, I solemnly forgive my
seducer for all the ills, the accumulated evils which his allurements, his
deceit, and cruelty, have for twenty years past drawn upon me.
</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Enter a</i> COUNTRY GIRL <i>with a basket.</i>
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
[<i>near fainting</i>]. My dear child, if you could spare me a trifle&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GIRL.<br/>
I have not a farthing in the world&mdash;But I am going to market to sell my
eggs, and as I come back I&rsquo;ll give you three-pence&mdash;And I&rsquo;ll
be back as soon as ever I can. [<i>Exit.</i>
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
There was a time when I was as happy as this country girl, and as willing to
assist the poor in distress. [<i>Retires to the tree and sits down.</i>]
</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Enter</i> FREDERICK&mdash;<i>He is dressed in a German soldier&rsquo;s
uniform, has a knapsack on his shoulders, appears in high spirits, and stops at
the door of the inn.</i>
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Halt! Stand at ease! It is a very hot day&mdash;A draught of good wine will not
be amiss. But first let me consult my purse. [<i>Takes out a couple of pieces
of money, which he turns about in his hand.</i>] This will do for a
breakfast&mdash;the other remains for my dinner; and in the evening I shall be
home. [<i>Calls out</i>] Ha! Halloo! Landlord! [<i>Takes notice of</i> Agatha,
<i>who is leaning against the tree.</i>] Who is that? A poor sick woman! She
don&rsquo;t beg; but her appearance makes me think she is in want. Must one
always wait to give till one is asked? Shall I go without my breakfast now, or
lose my dinner? The first I think is best. Ay, I don&rsquo;t want a breakfast,
for dinner time will soon be here. To do good satisfies both hunger and thirst.
[<i>Going towards her with the money in his hand.</i>] Take this, good woman.
</p>

<p class="center">
[<i>She stretches her hand for the gift, looks steadfastly at him, and cries
out with astonishment and joy.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Frederick!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Mother! [<i>With astonishment and grief.</i>] Mother! For God&rsquo;s sake what
is this! How is this! And why do I find my mother thus? Speak!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
I cannot speak, dear son! [<i>Rising and embracing him.</i>] My dear Frederick!
The joy is too great&mdash;I was not prepared&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Dear mother, compose yourself: [<i>leans her head against his breast</i>] now,
then, be comforted. How she trembles! She is fainting.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
I am so weak, and my head so giddy&mdash;I had nothing to eat all yesterday.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Good heavens! Here is my little money, take it all! Oh mother! mother! [<i>Runs
to the inn</i>]. Landlord! Landlord! [<i>knocking violently at the door.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
What is the matter?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
A bottle of wine&mdash;quick, quick!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
[<i>surprised</i>]. A bottle of wine! For who?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
For me. Why do you ask? Why don&rsquo;t you make haste?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
Well, well, Mr. soldier: but can you pay for it?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Here is money&mdash;make haste, or I&rsquo;ll break every window in your house.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
Patience! Patience! [<i>goes off.</i>
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
[<i>to Agatha</i>]. You were hungry yesterday when I sat down to a comfortable
dinner. You were hungry when I partook of a good supper. Oh! Why is so much
bitter mixed with the joy of my return?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Be patient, my dear Frederick. Since I see you, I am well. But I <i>have
been</i> very ill: so ill, that I despaired of ever beholding you again.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Ill, and I was not with you? I will, now, never leave you more. Look, mother,
how tall and strong I am grown. These arms can now afford you support. They
can, and shall, procure you subsistence.
</p>

<p class="center">
[Landlord <i>coming out of the house with a small pitcher.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
Here is wine&mdash;a most delicious nectar. [<i>Aside.</i>] It is only Rhenish;
but it will pass for the best old Hock.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
[<i>impatiently snatching the pitcher</i>]. Give it me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
No, no&mdash;the money first. One shilling and two-pence, if you please.
</p>

<p class="center">
[Frederick <i>gives him money.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
This is all I have.&mdash;Here, here, mother.
</p>

<p class="center">
[<i>While she drinks</i> Landlord <i>counts the money.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
Three halfpence too short! However, one must be charitable. [<i>Exit</i>
Landlord.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
I thank you, my dear Frederick&mdash;Wine revives me&mdash;Wine from the hand
of my son gives me almost a new life.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Don&rsquo;t speak too much, mother.&mdash;Take your time.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Tell me, dear child, how you have passed the five years since you left me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Both good and bad, mother. To day plenty&mdash;to-morrow not so much&mdash;And
sometimes nothing at all.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
You have not written to me this long while.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Dear mother, consider the great distance I was from you!&mdash;And then, in the
time of war, how often letters miscarry.&mdash;Besides&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
No matter now I see you. But have you obtained your discharge?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Oh, no, mother&mdash;I have leave of absence only for two months; and that for
a particular reason. But I will not quit you so soon, now I find you are in
want of my assistance.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
No, no, Frederick; your visit will make me so well, that I shall in a very
short time recover strength to work again; and you must return to your regiment
when your furlough is expired. But you told me leave of absence was granted you
for a particular reason.&mdash;What reason?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
When I left you five years ago, you gave me every thing you could afford, and
all you thought would be necessary for me. But one trifle you forgot, which
was, the certificate of my birth from the church-book.&mdash;You know in this
country there is nothing to be done without it. At the time of parting from
you, I little thought it could be of that consequence to me which I have since
found it would have been. Once I became tired of a soldier&rsquo;s life, and in
the hope I should obtain my discharge, offered myself to a master to learn a
profession; but his question was, &ldquo;Where is your certificate from the
church-book of the parish in which you were born?&rdquo; It vexed me that I had
not it to produce, for my comrades laughed at my disappointment. My captain
behaved kinder, for he gave me leave to come home to fetch it&mdash;and you
see, mother, here I am.
</p>

<p class="center">
[<i>During his speech</i> Agatha <i>is confused and agitated.</i>
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
So, you are come for the purpose of fetching your certificate from the
church-book.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Yes, mother.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Oh! oh!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
What is the matter? [<i>She bursts into tears.</i>] For heaven&rsquo;s sake,
mother, tell me what&rsquo;s the matter?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
You have no certificate.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
No!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
No.&mdash;The laws of Germany excluded you from being registered at your
birth&mdash;for&mdash;you are a natural son!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
[<i>starts&mdash;after a pause</i>]. So!&mdash;And who is my father?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Oh Frederick, your wild looks are daggers to my heart. Another time.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
[<i>endeavouring to conceal his emotion</i>]. No, no&mdash;I am still your
son&mdash;and you are still my mother. Only tell me, who is my father?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
When we parted five years ago, you were too young to be intrusted with a secret
of so much importance.&mdash;But the time is come when I can, in confidence,
open my heart, and unload that burthen with which it has been long oppressed.
And yet, to reveal my errors to my child, and sue for his mild judgment on my
conduct&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
You have nothing to sue for; only explain this mystery.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
I will, I will. But&mdash;my tongue is locked with remorse and shame. You must
not look at me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Not look at you! Cursed be that son who could find his mother guilty, although
the world should call her so.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Then listen to me, and take notice of that village, [<i>pointing</i>] of that
castle, and of that church. In that village I was born&mdash;in that church I
was baptized. My parents were poor, but reputable farmers.&mdash;The lady of
that castle and estate requested them to let me live with her, and she would
provide for me through life. They resigned me; and at the age of fourteen I
went to my patroness. She took pleasure to instruct me in all kinds of female
literature and accomplishments, and three happy years had passed under
protection, when her only son, who was an officer in the Saxon service,
obtained permission to come home. I had never seen him before&mdash;he was a
handsome young man&mdash;in my eyes a prodigy; for he talked of love, and
promised me marriage. He was the first man who had ever spoken to me on such a
subject.&mdash;His flattery made me vain, and his repeated
vows&mdash;Don&rsquo;t look at me, dear Frederick!&mdash;I can say no more.
[Frederick <i>with his eyes cast down, takes her hand, and puts it to his
heart.</i>] Oh! oh! my son! I was intoxicated by the fervent caresses of a
young, inexperienced, capricious man, and did not recover from the delirium
till it was too late.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
[<i>after a pause</i>]. Go on.&mdash;Let me know more of my father.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
When the time drew near that I could no longer conceal my guilt and shame, my
seducer prevailed upon me not to expose him to the resentment of his mother. He
renewed his former promises of marriage at her death;&mdash;on which relying, I
gave him my word to be secret&mdash;and I have to this hour buried his name
deep in my heart.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Proceed, proceed! give me full information&mdash;I will have courage to hear it
all. [<i>Greatly agitated.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
His leave of absence expired, he returned to his regiment, depending on my
promise, and well assured of my esteem. As soon as my situation became known, I
was questioned, and received many severe reproaches: but I refused to confess
who was my undoer; and for that obstinacy was turned from the castle.&mdash;I
went to my parents; but their door was shut against me. My mother, indeed, wept
as she bade me quit her sight for ever; but my father wished increased
affliction might befall me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
[<i>weeping</i>]. Be quick with your narrative, or you&rsquo;ll break my heart.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
I now sought protection from the old clergyman of the parish. He received me
with compassion. On my knees I begged forgiveness for the scandal I had caused
to his parishioners; promised amendment; and he said he did not doubt me.
Through his recommendation I went to town; and hid in humble lodgings, procured
the means of subsistence by teaching to the neighbouring children what I had
learnt under the tuition of my benefactress.&mdash;To instruct you, my
Frederick, was my care and delight; and in return for your filial love I would
not thwart your wishes when they led to a soldier&rsquo;s life: but I saw you
go from me with an aching heart. Soon after, my health declined, I was
compelled to give up my employment, and, by degrees, became the object you now
see me. But, let me add, before I close my calamitous story, that&mdash;when I
left the good old clergyman, taking along with me his kind advice and his
blessing, I left him with a firm determination to fulfil the vow I had made of
repentance and amendment. I <i>have</i> fulfilled it&mdash;and now, Frederick,
you may look at me again. [<i>He embraces her.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
But my father all this time? [<i>mournfully</i>] I apprehend he died.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
No&mdash;he married.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Married!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
A woman of virtue&mdash;of noble birth and immense fortune. Yet, [<i>weeps</i>]
I had written to him many times; had described your infant innocence and wants;
had glanced obliquely at former promises&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
[<i>rapidly</i>]. No answer to these letters?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Not a word.&mdash;But in time of war, you know, letters miscarry.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Nor did he ever return to this estate?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
No&mdash;since the death of his mother this castle has only been inhabited by
servants&mdash;for he settled as far off as Alsace, upon the estate of his
wife.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
I will carry you in my arms to Alsace. No&mdash;why should I ever know my
father, if he is a villain! My heart is satisfied with a
mother.&mdash;No&mdash;I will not go to him. I will not disturb his
peace&mdash;I leave that task to his conscience. What say you, mother,
can&rsquo;t we do without him? [<i>Struggling between tears and his pride.</i>]
We don&rsquo;t want him. I will write directly to my captain. Let the
consequence be what it will, leave you again I cannot. Should I be able to get
my discharge, I will work all day at the plough, and all the night with my pen.
It will do, mother, it will do! Heaven&rsquo;s goodness will assist me&mdash;it
will prosper the endeavours of a dutiful son for the sake of a helpless mother.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
[<i>presses him to her breast</i>]. Where could be found such another son?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
But tell me my father&rsquo;s name, that I may know how to shun him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Baron Wildenhaim.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Baron Wildenhaim! I shall never forget it.&mdash;Oh! you are near fainting.
Your eyes are cast down. What&rsquo;s the matter? Speak, mother!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Nothing particular.&mdash;Only fatigued with talking. I wish to take a little
rest.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
I did not consider that we have been all this time in the open road. [<i>Goes
to the Inn, and knocks at the door.</i>] Here, Landlord!

</p>

<p class="dialog">

Make haste, and get a bed ready for this good woman.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LANDLORD.<br/>
[<i>with a sneer</i>]. A bed for this good woman! ha, ha ha! She slept last
night in that pent-house; so she may to-night. [<i>Exit, shutting the door.</i>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>

Good day, young soldier.&mdash;What is it you want?

Good friend, look at that poor woman. She is perishing in the public road! It
is my mother.&mdash;Will you give her a small corner in your hut? I beg for
mercy&rsquo;s sake&mdash;Heaven will reward you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
Can&rsquo;t you speak quietly? I understand you very well. [<i>Calls at the
door of the hut.</i>] Wife, shake up our bed&mdash;here&rsquo;s a poor sick
woman wants it. [<i>Enter</i> WIFE]. Why could not you say all this in fewer
words? Why such a long preamble? Why for mercy&rsquo;s sake, and heaven&rsquo;s
reward? Why talk about reward for such trifles as these? Come, let us lead her
in; and welcome she shall be to a bed, as good as I can give her; and our
homely fare.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Ten thousand thanks, and blessings on you!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
Thanks and blessings! here&rsquo;s a piece of work indeed about nothing! Good

<h3>SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>A room in the Cottage.</i>
</p>

<p class="center">
AGATHA, COTTAGER, <i>his</i> WIFE, <i>and</i> FREDERICK
<i>discovered</i>&mdash;AGATHA <i>reclined upon a wooden bench,</i> FREDERICK
<i>leaning over her.</i>
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Good people have you nothing to give her? Nothing that&rsquo;s nourishing.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
Run, husband, run, and fetch a bottle of wine from the landlord of the inn.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
No, no&mdash;his wine is as bad as his heart: she has drank some of it, which I
am afraid has turned to poison.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
Suppose, wife, you look for a new-laid egg?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
Or a drop of brandy, husband&mdash;that mostly cures me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Do you hear, mother&mdash;will you, mother? [Agatha <i>makes a sign with her
hand as if she could not take any thing.</i>] She will not. Is there no doctor
in this neighbourhood?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
At the end of the village there lives a horse-doctor. I have never heard of any
other.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
What shall I do? She is dying. My mother is dying.&mdash;Pray for her, good
people!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Make yourself easy, dear Frederick, I am well, only weak&mdash;Some wholesome
nourishment&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Yes, mother, directly&mdash;directly. [<i>Aside</i>] Oh where shall I&mdash;no
money&mdash;not a farthing left.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
Oh, dear me! Had you not paid the rent yesterday, husband&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
I then, should know what to do. But as I hope for mercy, I have not a penny in
my house.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Then I must&mdash;[<i>Apart, coming forward</i>]&mdash;Yes, I will go, and
beg.&mdash;But should I be refused&mdash;I will then&mdash;I leave my mother in
your care, good people&mdash;Do all you can for her, I beseech you! I shall
soon be with you again. [<i>Goes off in haste and confusion.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
If he should go to our parson, I am sure he would give him something.
</p>

<p class="center">
[Agatha <i>having revived by degrees during the scene, rises.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Is that good old man still living, who was minister here some time ago?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
No&mdash;It pleased Providence to take that worthy man to heaven two years
ago.&mdash;We have lost in him both a friend and a father. We shall never get
such another.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
Wife, wife, our present rector is likewise a very good man.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
Yes! But he is so very young.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
Our late parson was once young too.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
[<i>to</i> Agatha.] This young man being tutor in our Baron&rsquo;s family, he
was very much beloved by them all; and so the Baron gave him this living in
consequence.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
And well he deserved it, for his pious instructions to our young lady: who is,
in consequence, good, and friendly to every body.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
What young lady do you mean?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
Our Baron&rsquo;s daughter.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Is she here?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
Dear me! Don&rsquo;t you know that? I thought every body had known that. It is
almost five weeks since the Baron and all his family arrived at the castle.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Baron Wildenhaim?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
Yes, Baron Wildenhaim.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
And his lady?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
His lady died in France many miles from hence, and her death, I suppose, was
the cause of his coming to this estate&mdash;For the Baron has not been here
till within these five weeks ever since he was married. We regretted his
absence much, and his arrival has caused great joy.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
[<i>addressing her discourse to</i> Agatha.] By all accounts the Baroness was
very haughty; and very whimsical.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
Wife, wife, never speak ill of the dead. Say what you please against the
living, but not a word against the dead.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
And yet, husband, I believe the dead care the least what is said against
them&mdash;And so, if you please, I&rsquo;ll tell my story. The late Baroness
was, they say, haughty and proud; and they do say, the Baron was not so happy
as he might have been; but he, bless him, our good Baron is still the same as
when a boy. Soon after Madam had closed her eyes, he left France, and came to
Waldenhaim, his native country.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
Many times has he joined in our village dances. Afterwards, when he became an
officer, he was rather wild, as most young men are.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
Yes, I remember when he fell in love with poor Agatha, Friburg&rsquo;s
daughter: what a piece of work that was&mdash;It did not do him much credit.
That was a wicked thing.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
Have done&mdash;no more of this&mdash;It is not well to stir up old grievances.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
Why, you said I might speak ill of the living. &rsquo;Tis very hard indeed, if
one must not speak ill of one&rsquo;s neighbours, dead, nor alive.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
Who knows whether he was the father of Agatha&rsquo;s child? She never said he
was.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
Nobody but him&mdash;that I am sure&mdash;I would lay a wager&mdash;no, no
husband&mdash;you must not take his part&mdash;it was very wicked! Who knows
what is now become of that poor creature? She has not been heard of this many a
year. May be she is starving for hunger. Her father might have lived longer
too, if that misfortune had not happened.
</p>

<p class="center">
[Agatha <i>faints.</i>]

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
See here! Help! She is fainting&mdash;take hold!

No, I shall not be in a hurry&mdash;I love my daughter too well. We must be
better acquainted before I give her to him. I shall not sacrifice my Amelia to
the will of others, as I myself was sacrificed. The poor girl might, in
thoughtlessness, say yes, and afterwards be miserable. What a pity she is not a

Very well.

No: not that&mdash;I dreamt we were all still in France, and he, my tutor, just

Psha! I want to know if you can love the Count. You saw him at the last ball we

BARON.<br/>
But I think it proper to acquaint you he is rich, and of great consequence:
rich and of consequence; do you hear?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Yes, dear papa. But my tutor has always told me that birth and fortune are
inconsiderable things, and cannot give happiness.

You put me out of patience. Hear, Amelia! [<i>stops short, and speaks

I am sorry I have not seen the world.
</p>

Wherefore?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Because I might then, perhaps, admire you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">

True;&mdash;for I am an epitome of the world. In my travels I learnt delicacy
in Italy&mdash;hauteur, in Spain&mdash;in France, enterprize&mdash;in Russia,

the wilds of America, I learnt love.

<p class="dialog">

</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
I shall not command, neither persuade her to the marriage&mdash;I know too well
the fatal influence of parents on such a subject. Objections to be sure, if
they could be removed&mdash;But when you find a man&rsquo;s head without
brains, and his bosom without a heart, these are important articles to supply.
Young as you are, Anhalt, I know no one so able to restore, or to bestow those
blessings on his fellow-creatures, as you. [Anhalt <i>bows.</i>] The Count
wants a little of my daughter&rsquo;s simplicity and sensibility.&mdash;Take
him under your care while he is here, and make him something like
yourself.&mdash;You have succeeded to my wish in the education of my
daughter.&mdash;Form the Count after your own manner.&mdash;I shall then have
what I have sighed for all my life&mdash;a son.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
With your permission, Baron, I will ask one question. What remains to interest
you in favour of a man, whose head and heart are good for nothing?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Birth and fortune. Yet, if I thought my daughter absolutely disliked him, or
that she loved another, I would not thwart a first affection;&mdash;no, for the
world, I would not. [<i>sighing.</i>] But that her affections are already
bestowed, is not probable.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Are you of opinion that she will never fall in love?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Oh! no. I am of opinion that no woman ever arrived at the age of twenty without
that misfortune.&mdash;But this is another subject.&mdash;Go to
Amelia&mdash;explain to her the duties of a wife and of a mother.&mdash;If she
comprehends them, as she ought, then ask her if she thinks she could fulfil
those duties, as the wife of Count Cassel.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
I will.&mdash;But&mdash;I&mdash;Miss Wildenhaim&mdash;[<i>confused.</i>
I&mdash;I shall&mdash;I&mdash;I shall obey your commands.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Do so. [<i>gives a deep sigh.</i>] Ah! so far this weight is removed; but there
lies still a heavier next my heart.&mdash;You understand me.&mdash;How is it,
Mr. Anhalt? Have you not yet been able to make any discoveries on that
unfortunate subject?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
I have taken infinite pains; but in vain. No such person is to be found.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Believe me, this burthen presses on my thoughts so much, that many nights I go
without sleep. A man is sometimes tempted to commit such depravity when
young.&mdash;Oh, Anhalt! had I, in my youth, had you for a tutor;&mdash;but I
had no instructor but my passions; no governor but my own will. [<i>Exit.</i>

For matrimony.

All things that I don&rsquo;t know, and don&rsquo;t understand, are quite

AMELIA.<br/>
Then I beg first to be acquainted with the good.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state, matrimony may be called
a happy life. When such a wedded pair find thorns in their path, each will be
eager, for the sake of the other, to tear them from the root. Where they have
to mount hills, or wind a labyrinth, the most experienced will lead the way,
and be a guide to his companion. Patience and love will accompany them in their
journey, while melancholy and discord they leave far behind.&mdash;Hand in hand
they pass on from morning till evening, through their summer&rsquo;s day, till
the night of age draws on, and the sleep of death overtakes the one. The other,
weeping and mourning, yet looks forward to the bright region where he shall
meet his still surviving partner, among trees and flowers which themselves have
planted, in fields of eternal verdure.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
You may tell my father&mdash;I&rsquo;ll marry. [<i>Rises.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
[<i>rising</i>]. This picture is pleasing; but I must beg you not to forget
that there is another on the same subject.&mdash;When convenience, and fair
appearance joined to folly and ill-humour, forge the fetters of matrimony, they
gall with their weight the married pair. Discontented with each other&mdash;at
variance in opinions&mdash;their mutual aversion increases with the years they
live together. They contend most, where they should most unite; torment, where
they should most soothe. In this rugged way, choaked with the weeds of
suspicion, jealousy, anger, and hatred, they take their daily journey, till one
of these <i>also</i> sleep in death. The other then lifts up his dejected head,
and calls out in acclamations of joy&mdash;Oh, liberty! dear liberty!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>

AMELIA.<br/>
I know you are not&mdash;And as you have for a long time instructed me, why
should not I now begin to teach you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Teach me what?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Whatever I know, and you don&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
There are some things I had rather never know.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
So you may remember I said when you began to teach me mathematics. I said I had
rather not know it&mdash;But now I have learnt it gives me a great deal of
pleasure&mdash;and [<i>hesitating</i>] perhaps, who can tell, but that I might
teach something as pleasant to you, as resolving a problem is to me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Woman herself is a problem.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
And I&rsquo;ll teach you to make her out.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
<i>You</i> teach?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Why not? none but a woman can teach the science of herself: and though I own I
am very young, a young woman may be as agreeable for a tutoress as an old
one.&mdash;I am sure I always learnt faster from you than from the old
clergyman who taught me before you came.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
This is nothing to the subject.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
What is the subject?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
&mdash;&mdash; Love.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
[<i>going up to him</i>]. Come, then, teach it me&mdash;teach it me as you
taught me geography, languages, and other important things.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
[<i>turning from her</i>] Pshaw!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Ah! you won&rsquo;t&mdash;You know you have already taught me that, and you
won&rsquo;t begin again.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
You misconstrue&mdash;you misconceive every thing I say or do. The subject I
came to you upon was marriage.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
A very proper subject from the man who has taught me love, and I accept the
proposal [<i>curtsying</i>].
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Again you misconceive and confound me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Ay, I see how it is&mdash;You have no inclination to experience with me
&ldquo;the good part of matrimony:&rdquo; I am not the female with whom you
would like to go &ldquo;hand in hand up hills, and through
labyrinths&rdquo;&mdash;with whom you would like to &ldquo;root up thorns; and
with whom you would delight to plant lilies and roses.&rdquo; No, you had
rather call out, &ldquo;O liberty, dear liberty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Why do you force from me, what it is villanous to own?&mdash;I love you more
than life&mdash;Oh, Amelia! had we lived in those golden times, which the
poet&rsquo;s picture, no one but you&mdash;&mdash;But as the world is changed,
your birth and fortune make our union impossible&mdash;To preserve the
character, and more the feelings of an honest man, I would not marry you
without the consent of your father&mdash;And could I, dare I propose it to him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
He has commanded me never to conceal or disguise the truth. I will propose it
to him. The subject of the Count will force me to speak plainly, and this will
be the most proper time, while he can compare the merit of you both.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
I conjure you not to think of exposing yourself and me to his resentment.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
It is my father&rsquo;s will that I should marry&mdash;It is my father&rsquo;s
wish to see me happy&mdash;If then you love me as you say, I will marry; and
will be happy&mdash;but only with you.&mdash;I will tell him this.&mdash;At
first he will start; then grow angry; then be in a passion&mdash;In his passion
he will call me &ldquo;undutiful:&rdquo; but he will soon recollect himself,
and resume his usual smiles, saying &ldquo;Well, well, if he love you, and you
love him, in the name of heaven, let it be.&rdquo; Then I shall hug him round
the neck, kiss his hands, run away from him, and fly to you; it will soon be
known that I am your bride, the whole village will come to wish me joy, and
heaven&rsquo;s blessing will follow.

Oh Muse, ascend the forked mount.<br/>
    And lofty strains prepare,<br/>
About a Baron and a Count,<br/>
    Who went to hunt the hare.<br/>
<br/>
The hare she ran with utmost speed,<br/>
    And sad, and anxious looks,<br/>
Because the furious hounds indeed,<br/>
    Were near to her, gadzooks.<br/>
<br/>
At length, the Count and Baron bold<br/>
    Their footsteps homeward bended;<br/>
For why, because, as you were told,<br/>
    The hunting it was ended.<br/>
<br/>
Before them strait a youth appears,<br/>
    Who made a piteous pother,<br/>
And told a tale with many tears,<br/>
    About his dying mother.<br/>
<br/>
The youth was in severe distress,<br/>
    And seem&rsquo;d as he had spent all,<br/>
He look&rsquo;d a soldier by his dress;<br/>
    For that was regimental.<br/>
<br/>
The Baron&rsquo;s heart was full of ruth,<br/>
    While from his eye fell brine o!<br/>
And soon he gave the mournful youth<br/>
    A little ready rino.<br/>
<br/>
He gave a shilling as I live,<br/>
    Which, sure, was mighty well;<br/>
But to some people if you give<br/>
    An inch&mdash;they&rsquo;ll take an ell.<br/>
<br/>
The youth then drew his martial knife,<br/>
    And seiz&rsquo;d the Baron&rsquo;s collar,<br/>
He swore he&rsquo;d have the Baron&rsquo;s life,<br/>
    Or else another dollar.<br/>
<br/>
Then did the Baron in a fume,<br/>
    Soon raise a mighty din,<br/>
Whereon came butler, huntsman, groom,<br/>
    And eke the whipper-in.<br/>
<br/>
Maugre this young man&rsquo;s warlike coat,<br/>
    They bore him off to prison;<br/>
And held so strongly by his throat,<br/>
    They almost stopt his whizzen.<br/>
<br/>
Soon may a neckcloth, call&rsquo;d a rope,<br/>
    Of robbing cure this elf;<br/>
If so I&rsquo;ll write, without a trope,<br/>
    His dying speech myself.<br/>
<br/>
And had the Baron chanc&rsquo;d to die,<br/>
    Oh! grief to all the nation,<br/>
I must have made an elegy,<br/>
    And not this fine narration.

AMELIA.<br/>
Your muse, Mr. Butler, is in a very inventive humour this morning.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
And your tale too improbable, even for fiction.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BUTLER.<br/>
Improbable! It&rsquo;s a real fact.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
What, a robber in our grounds, at noon-day? Very likely indeed!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BUTLER.<br/>
I don&rsquo;t say it was likely&mdash;I only say it is true.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
No, no, Mr. Verdun, we find no fault with your poetry; but don&rsquo;t attempt
to impose it upon us for truth.

<p class="dialog">

<p class="dialog">

I won&rsquo;t be forgiven, for I speak truth&mdash;And here the robber comes,

Look! as I live, so he does&mdash;They come nearer; he&rsquo;s a young man, and

For Heaven&rsquo;s sake spare me your congratulations. The old Butler, in
coming up stairs, has already overwhelmed me with them.

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Then, it is true, my Lord? I could hardly believe the old man.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
And the young prisoner, with all his honest looks, is a robber?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
He is; but I verily believe for the first and last time. A most extraordinary
event, Mr. Anhalt This young man begged; then drew his sword upon me; but he
trembled so, when he seized me by the breast, a child might have overpowered
him. I almost wish he had made his escape&mdash;this adventure may cost him his
life, and I might have preserved it with one dollar: but, now, to save him
would set a bad example.

Oh no! my lord, have pity on him! Plead for him, Mr. Anhalt!

Do you hear, Mr. Anhalt?

<p class="dialog">

Something of importance! to plead for the young man, I suppose! But
that&rsquo;s a subject I must not listen to. [<i>Exit.</i>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
I wish to plead for two young men&mdash;For one, that he may be let out of

such a place; and perhaps&mdash;[<i>Calls</i>] Butler! Butler! Come this way. I

<p class="dialog">

Some fine black bread; and water as clear as crystal.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Are you not ashamed! Even my father pities him. Go directly down to the
kitchen, and desire the cook to give you something good and comfortable; and
then go into the cellar for a bottle of wine.

<p class="dialog">
BUTLER.<br/>
Good and comfortable indeed!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
And carry both to the tower.

I am willing at any time, dear Lady, to obey your orders; but, on this

Ah! My father was in the height of passion when he gave it.

Whatsoever his passion might be, it is the duty of a true, and honest dependent

water&mdash;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll read my
verses to him.

How a few moments destroy the happiness of man! When I, this morning, set out

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
I wish to bring comfort and avoid upbraidings: for your own conscience will
reproach you more than the voice of a preacher. From the sensibility of your
countenance, together with a language, and address superior to the vulgar, it
appears, young man, you have had an education, which should have preserved you
from a state like this.

FREDERICK.<br/>
My education I owe to my mother. Filial love, in return, has plunged me into
the state you see. A civil magistrate will condemn according to the law&mdash;A
priest, in judgment, is not to consider the act itself, but the impulse which
led to the act.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
I shall judge with all the lenity my religion dictates: and you are the
prisoner of a nobleman, who compassionates you for the affection which you bear
towards your mother; for he has sent to the village where you directed him, and
has found the account you gave relating to her true.&mdash;With this impression
in your favour, it is my advice, that you endeavour to see and supplicate the
Baron for your release from prison, and all the peril of his justice.

guilt. Follow me. [<i>Exit.</i>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
I hope you will judge more favourably of Count Cassel&rsquo;s understanding
since the private interview you have had with him. Confess to me the exact
effect of the long conference between you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
To make me hate him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
What has he done?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Oh! told me of such barbarous deeds he has committed.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
What deeds?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Made vows of love to so many women, that, on his marriage with me, a hundred
female hearts will at least be broken.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Psha! do you believe him?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Suppose I do not; is it to his honour that I believe he tells a falsehood?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
He is mistaken merely.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Indeed, my Lord, in one respect I am sure he speaks truth. For our old Butler
told my waiting-maid of a poor young creature who has been deceived, undone;
and she, and her whole family, involved in shame and sorrow by his perfidy.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Are you sure the Butler said this?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
See him and ask him. He knows the whole story, indeed he does; the names of the
persons, and every circumstance.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Desire he may be sent to me.

AMELIA.<br/>
[<i>goes to the door and calls</i>]. Order old Verdun to come to the Baron

BARON.<br/>
I know tale-bearers are apt to be erroneous. I&rsquo;ll hear from himself, the
account you speak of.

I believe it is in verse.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>

But, then, indeed it&rsquo;s true.

</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Verdun, pray have not you some true poetry?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BUTLER.<br/>
All my poetry is true&mdash;and so far, better than some people&rsquo;s prose.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
But I want prose on this occasion, and command you to give me nothing else.
[Butler <i>bows</i>.] Have you heard of an engagement which Count Cassel is
under to any other woman than my daughter?

<p class="dialog">
BUTLER.<br/>
I am to tell your honour in prose?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Certainly. [Butler <i>appears uneasy and loath to speak.</i>] Amelia, he does
not like to divulge what he knows in presence of a third person&mdash;leave the
room. [<i>Exit</i> Amelia.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BUTLER.<br/>
No, no&mdash;that did not cause my reluctance to speak.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
What then?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BUTLER.<br/>
Your not allowing me to speak in verse&mdash;for here is the poetic poem.
[<i>Holding up a paper</i>.]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
How dare you presume to contend with my will? Tell in plain language all you
know on the subject I have named.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BUTLER.<br/>
Well, then, my Lord, if you must have the account in quiet prose, thus it
was&mdash;Phœbus, one morning, rose in the East, and having handed in the
long-expected day, he called up his brother Hymen&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>

</p>

<p class="dialog">
BUTLER.<br/>
Ay; I knew you&rsquo;d like it best in verse&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
There lived a lady in this land,<br/>
    Whose charms the heart made tingle;<br/>
At church she had not given her hand,<br/>
    And therefore still was single.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Keep to prose.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BUTLER.<br/>
I will, my Lord; but I have repeated it so often in verse, I scarce know
how.&mdash;Count Cassel, influenced by the designs of Cupid in his very worst
humour,

&ldquo;Count Cassel wooed this maid so rare,<br/>
    And in her eye found grace;<br/>
And if his purpose was not fair,&rdquo;

<p class="dialog">

No verse.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BUTLER.<br/>
</p>

<p class="poem">
    &ldquo;It probably was base.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
I beg pardon, my Lord; but the verse will intrude in spite of my efforts to
forget it. &rsquo;Tis as difficult for me at times to forget, as &rsquo;tis for
other men at times to remember. But in plain truth, my Lord, the Count was
treacherous, cruel, forsworn.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
I am astonished!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BUTLER.<br/>
And would be more so if you would listen to the whole poem. [<i>Most

BARON.<br/>
You know the family? All the parties?

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Count, you see me agitated.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
What can be the cause?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll not keep you in doubt a moment. You are accused, young man, of being
engaged to another woman while you offer marriage to my child.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
To only <i>one</i> other woman?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
What do you mean?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
My meaning is, that when a man is young and rich, has travelled, and is no
personal object of disapprobation, to have made vows but to one woman, is an
absolute slight upon the rest of the sex.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Without evasion, Sir, do you know the name of Baden? Was there ever a promise
of marriage made by you to his daughter? Answer me plainly: or must I take a
journey to inquire of the father?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
No&mdash;he can tell you no more than, I dare say, you already know; and which
I shall not contradict.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Amazing insensibility! And can you hold your head erect while you acknowledge
perfidy?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
My dear baron,&mdash;if every man, who deserves to have a charge such as this
brought against him, was not permitted to look up&mdash;it is a doubt whom we
might not meet crawling on all fours. [<i>he accidently taps the Baron&rsquo;s
shoulder.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
[<i>starts&mdash;recollects himself&mdash;then in a faultering voice</i>].
Yet&mdash;nevertheless&mdash;the act is so atrocious&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
But nothing new.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
[<i>faintly</i>]. Yes&mdash;I hope&mdash;I hope it is new.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
What, did you never meet with such a thing before?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
[<i>agitated</i>]. If I have&mdash;I pronounced the man who so offended&mdash;a
villain.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
You are singularly scrupulous. I question if the man thought himself so.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Yes he did.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
How do you know?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
[<i>hesitating</i>]. I have heard him say so.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
But he ate, drank, and slept, I suppose?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
[<i>confused</i>]. Perhaps he did.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
And was merry with his friends; and his friends as fond of him as ever?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Perhaps [<i>confused</i>]&mdash;perhaps they were.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
And perhaps he now and then took upon him to lecture young men for their
gallantries?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Perhaps he did.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
Why, then, after all, Baron, your villain is a mighty good, prudent, honest
fellow; and I have no objection to your giving me that name.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
But do you not think of some atonement to the unfortunate girl?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
Did <i>your</i> villain atone?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
No: when his reason was matured, he wished to make some recompense; but his
endeavours were too late.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
I will follow his example, and wait till my reason is matured, before I think
myself competent to determine what to do.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
And till that time I defer your marriage with my daughter.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
Would you delay her happiness so long? Why, my dear Baron, considering the
fashionable life I lead, it may be ten years before my judgment arrives to its
necessary standard.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
I have the head-ach, Count&mdash;These tidings have discomposed, disordered
me&mdash;I beg your absence for a few minutes.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
I obey&mdash;And let me assure you, my Lord, that, although, from the extreme
delicacy of your honour, you have ever through life shuddered at seduction;
yet, there are constitutions, and there are circumstances, in which it can be
palliated.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Never [<i>violently</i>].
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COUNT.<br/>
Not in a grave, serious, reflecting man such as <i>you</i>, I grant. But in a
gay, lively, inconsiderate, flimsy, frivolous coxcomb, such as myself, it is
excusable: for me to keep my word to a woman, would be deceit: &rsquo;tis not
expected of me. It is in my character to break oaths in love; as it is in your
nature, my Lord, never to have spoken any thing but wisdom and truth.

I heard the Count leave you, my Lord, and so I am come to enquire&mdash;&mdash;

BARON.<br/>
[<i>sitting down, and trying to compose himself</i>]. You are not to marry
count Cassel&mdash;And now, mention his name to me no more.

I won&rsquo;t&mdash;indeed I won&rsquo;t&mdash;for I hate his name.&mdash;But
thank you, my dear father, for this good news [<i>draws a chair, and sits on
the opposite side of the table on which he leans.&mdash;And after a pause</i>]
And who am I to marry?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
[<i>his head on his hand</i>]. I can&rsquo;t tell.
</p>

<p class="center">
[Amelia <i>appears to have something on her mind which she wishes to
disclose</i>.]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
I never liked the Count.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
No more did I.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
[<i>after a pause</i>]. I think love comes just as it pleases, without being
asked.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
It does so [<i>in deep thought</i>].
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
[<i>after another pause</i>]. And there are instances where, perhaps, the
object of love makes the passion meritorious.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
To be sure there are.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
For example; my affection for Mr. Anhalt as my tutor.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Right.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
[<i>after another pause</i>]. I should like to marry. [<i>sighing</i>.]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
So you shall [<i>a pause</i>]. It is proper for every body to marry.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Why, then, does not Mr. Anhalt marry?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
You must ask him that question yourself.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
I have.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
And what did he say?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Will you give me leave to tell you what he said?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Certainly.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
And you won&rsquo;t be angry?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Undoubtedly not.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Why, then&mdash;you know you commanded me never to disguise or conceal the
truth.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
I did so.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Why, then he said&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
What did he say?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
He said&mdash;he would not marry me without your consent for the world.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
[<i>starting from his chair</i>]. And pray, how came this the subject of your
conversation?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
[<i>rising</i>]. <i>I</i> brought it up.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
And what did you say?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
I said that birth and fortune were such old-fashioned things to me, I cared
nothing about either: and that I had once heard my father declare, he should
consult my happiness in marrying me, beyond any other consideration.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
I will once more repeat to you my sentiments. It is the custom in this country
for the children of nobility to marry only with their equals; but as my
daughter&rsquo;s content is more dear to me than an ancient custom, I would
bestow you on the first man I thought calculated to make you happy: by this I
do not mean to say that I should not be severely nice in the character of the
man to whom I gave you; and Mr. Anhalt, from his obligations to me, and his
high sense of honour, thinks too nobly&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Would it not be noble to make the daughter of his benefactor happy?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
But when that daughter is a child, and thinks like a child&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
No, indeed, papa, I begin to think very like a woman. Ask <i>him</i> if I
don&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Ask him! You feel gratitude for the instructions you have received from him,
and fancy it love.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Are there two gratitudes?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
What do you mean?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Because I feel gratitude to you; but that is very unlike the gratitude I feel
towards him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Indeed!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Yes; and then he feels another gratitude towards me. What&rsquo;s that?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Has he told you so?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Yes.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
That was not right of him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Oh! if you did but know how I surprized him!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Surprized him?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
He came to me by your command, to examine my heart respecting Count Cassel. I
told him that I would never marry the Count.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
But him?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Yes, him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Very fine indeed! And what was his answer?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
He talked of my rank in life; of my aunts and cousins; of my grandfather, and
great-grandfather; of his duty to you; and endeavoured to persuade me to think
no more of him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
He acted honestly.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
But not politely.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
No matter.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AMELIA.<br/>
Dear father! I shall never be able to love another&mdash;Never be happy with
any one else. [<i>Throwing herself on her knees</i>.]

MR. ANHALT.<br/>
My Lord, forgive me! I have ventured, on the privilege of my office, as a

to your presence, and hear his apology, or his supplication.

Well, bring him in, and do you wait in the adjoining room, till our conference

I shall obey your commands. [<i>He goes to door, and re-enters with</i>
Frederick. Anhalt <i>then retires at the same door</i>.]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
[<i>haughtily to</i> Frederick]. I know, young man, you plead your
mother&rsquo;s wants in excuse for an act of desperation: but powerful as this
plea might be in palliation of a fault, it cannot extenuate a crime like yours.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
I have a plea for my conduct even more powerful than a mother&rsquo;s wants.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
What&rsquo;s that?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
My father&rsquo;s cruelty.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
You have a father then?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
I have, and a rich one&mdash;Nay, one that&rsquo;s reputed virtuous, and
honourable. A great man, possessing estates and patronage in abundance; much
esteemed at court, and beloved by his tenants; kind, benevolent, honest,
generous&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
And with all those great qualities, abandons you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
He does, with all the qualities I mention.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Your father may do right; a dissipated, desperate youth, whom kindness cannot
draw from vicious habits, severity may.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
You are mistaken&mdash;My father does not discard me for my vices&mdash;He does
not know me&mdash;has never seen me&mdash;He abandoned me, even before I was
born.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
What do you say?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
The tears of my mother are all that I inherit from my father. Never has he
protected or supported me&mdash;never protected her.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Why don&rsquo;t you apply to his relations?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
They disown me, too&mdash;I am, they say, related to no one&mdash;All the world
disclaim me, except my mother&mdash;and there again, I have to thank my father.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
How so?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FREDERICK.<br/>
Because I am an illegitimate son.&mdash;My seduced mother has brought me up in
patient misery. Industry enabled her to give me an education; but the days of
my youth commenced with hardship, sorrow, and danger.&mdash;My companions lived
happy around me, and had a pleasing prospect in their view, while bread and
water only were my food, and no hopes joined to sweeten it. But my father felt
not that!

BARON.<br/>
[<i>to himself</i>]. He touches my heart.

After five years&rsquo; absence from my mother, I returned this very day, and
found her dying in the streets for want&mdash;Not even a hut to shelter her, or
a pallet of straw&mdash;But my father, he feels not that! He lives in a palace,
sleeps on the softest down, enjoys all the luxuries of the great; and when he
dies, a funeral sermon will praise his great benevolence, his Christian
charities.

<p class="center">

</p>

<p class="center">
AGATHA, COTTAGER, <i>and his</i> WIFE <i>discovered</i>.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Pray look and see if he is coming.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
It is of no use. I have been in the road; have looked up and down; but neither
see nor hear any thing of him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
Have a little patience.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
I wish you would step out once more&mdash;I think he cannot be far off.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
I will; I will go. [<i>Exit</i>.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
If your son knew what heaven had sent you, he would be here very soon.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
I feel so anxious&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
But why? I should think a purse of gold, such as you have received, would make
any body easy.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Where can he be so long? He has been gone four hours. Some ill must have
befallen him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
It is still broad day-light&mdash;don&rsquo;t think of any danger.&mdash;This
evening we must all be merry. I&rsquo;ll prepare the supper. What a good
gentleman our Baron must be! I am sorry I ever spoke a word against him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
How did he know I was here?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
WIFE.<br/>
Heaven only can tell. The servant that brought the money was very secret.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
[<i>to herself</i>]. I am astonished! I wonder! Oh! surely he has been
informed&mdash;Why else should he have sent so much money?

</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Well!&mdash;not yet!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
COTTAGER.<br/>
I might look till I am blind for him&mdash;but I saw our new Rector coming
along the road; he calls in sometimes. May be, he will this evening.
</p>

He is a very good gentleman; pays great attention to his parishioners; and

Yes, your Reverence; it is a poor sick woman, whom I took in doors.
</p>

MR. ANHALT.<br/>
You will be rewarded for it. [<i>to</i> Agatha.] May I beg leave to ask your

COTTAGER.<br/>

MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Now&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Before I tell you who I am, what I am, and what I was&mdash;&mdash;I must beg
to ask&mdash;Are you of this country?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
No&mdash;I was born in Alsace.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Did you know the late rector personally, whom you have succeeded?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
No.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Then you are not acquainted with my narrative?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Should I find you to be the person whom I have long been in search of, your
history is not altogether unknown to me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
&ldquo;That you have been in search of!&rdquo; Who gave you such a commission?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
A man, who, if it so prove, is much concerned for your misfortunes.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
How? Oh, Sir! tell me quickly&mdash;Whom do you think to find in me?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Agatha Friburg.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Yes, I am that unfortunate woman; and the man who pretends to take concern in
my misfortunes is&mdash;&mdash;Baron Wildenhaim&mdash;&mdash;he who betrayed
me, abandoned me and my child, and killed my parents.&mdash;He would now repair
our sufferings with this purse of gold. [<i>Takes out the purse</i>.] Whatever
may be your errand, Sir, whether to humble, or to protect me, it is alike
indifferent. I therefore request you to take this money to him who sent it.
Tell him, my honour has never been saleable. Tell him, destitute as I am, even
indigence will not tempt me to accept charity from my seducer. He despised my
heart&mdash;I despise his gold.&mdash;He has trampled on me&mdash;I trample on
his representative. [<i>Throws the purse on the ground</i>.]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Be patient&mdash;I give you my word, that when the Baron sent this present to
an unfortunate woman, for whom her son had supplicated, he did not know that
woman was Agatha.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
My son? what of my son?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Do not be alarmed&mdash;The Baron met with an affectionate son, who begged for
his sick mother, and it affected him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Begged of the Baron! of his father!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Yes; but they did not know each other; and the mother received the present on
the son&rsquo;s account.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Did not know each other? Where is my son?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
At the Castle.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
And still unknown?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Now he is known&mdash;an explanation has taken place;&mdash;and I am sent here
by the Baron, not to a stranger, but to Agatha Friburg&mdash;not with gold! his
commission was&mdash;&ldquo;do what your heart directs you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
How is my Frederick? How did the Baron receive him?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
I left him just in the moment the discovery was made. By this time your son is,
perhaps, in the arms of his father.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
Oh! is it possible that a man, who has been twenty years deaf to the voice of
nature, should change so suddenly?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
I do not mean to justify the Baron, but&mdash;he has loved you&mdash;and fear
of his noble kindred alone caused his breach of faith to you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
But to desert me wholly and wed another&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
War called him away&mdash;Wounded in the field, he was taken to the adjacent
seat of a nobleman, whose only daughter, by anxious attention to his recovery,
won his gratitude; and, influenced by the will of his worldly friends, he
married. But no sooner was I received into the family, and admitted to his
confidence, than he related to me your story; and at times would exclaim in
anguish&mdash;&ldquo;The proud imperious Baroness avenges the wrongs of my
deserted Agatha.&rdquo; Again, when he presented me this living, and I left
France to take possession of it, his last words before we parted,
were&mdash;&ldquo;The moment you arrive at Wildenhaim, make all enquiries to
find out my poor Agatha.&rdquo; Every letter from him contained &ldquo;Still,
still, no tidings of my Agatha.&rdquo; And fate ordained it should be so, till
this fortunate day.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
What you have said has made my heart overflow&mdash;where will this end?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
I know not yet the Baron&rsquo;s intentions: but your sufferings demand
immediate remedy: and one way only is left&mdash;Come with me to the castle. Do
not start&mdash;you shall be concealed in my apartments till you are called
for.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
I go to the Baron&rsquo;s?&mdash;No.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Go for the sake of your son&mdash;reflect, that his fortunes may depend upon
your presence.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
AGATHA.<br/>
And he is the only branch on which my hope still blossoms: the rest are
withered.&mdash;I will forget my wrongs as a woman, if the Baron will atone to
the mother&mdash;he shall have the woman&rsquo;s pardon, if he will merit the
mother&rsquo;s thanks&mdash;[<i>after a struggle</i>]&mdash;I <i>will</i> go to
the castle&mdash;for the sake of my Frederick, go even to his father. But where
are my good host and hostess, that I may take leave, and thank them for their
kindness?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>

produces. There she shall reign, and be sole mistress of the little paradise.
There her past sufferings shall be changed to peace and tranquility. On a

MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Now, then, it is my turn to state mine for the advice I have given you. But
first, I must presume to ask a few questions.&mdash;Did Agatha, through artful
insinuation, gain your affection? or did she give you cause to suppose her
inconstant?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
Neither&mdash;but for me, she was always virtuous and good.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Did it cost you trouble and earnest entreaty to make her otherwise?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
[<i>angrily</i>]. Yes.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
You pledged your honour?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
[<i>confused</i>]. Yes.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
Called God to witness?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BARON.<br/>
[<i>more confused</i>]. Yes.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MR. ANHALT.<br/>
The witness you called at that time was the Being who sees you now. What you
gave in pledge was your honour, which you must redeem. Therefore thank Heaven
that it is in your <i>power</i> to redeem it. By marrying Agatha the
ransom&rsquo;s made: and she brings a dower greater than any princess can
bestow&mdash;peace to your conscience. If you then esteem the value of this
portion, you will not hesitate a moment to exclaim,&mdash;Friends, wish me joy,
I will marry Agatha.

<p class="dialog">
Our drama now ended, I&rsquo;ll take up your time<br/>
Just a moment or two in defence of my <i>rhime</i>&mdash;<br/>
* &ldquo;Tho&rsquo; I hope that among you are <i>some</i> who
<i>admir&rsquo;d</i><br/>
&ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve hitherto said, dare I hope none are tir&rsquo;d?<br/>
&ldquo;But whether ye have, or have not heard enough,<br/>
&ldquo;Or whether nice critics will think it all stuff;<br/>
&ldquo;To myself <i>rhime</i> has ever appear&rsquo;d, I must own,<br/>
&ldquo;In its nature a sort of <i>philosopher&rsquo;s stone</i>;<br/>
&ldquo;And if Chymists wou&rsquo;d use it, they&rsquo;d not make a pother,<br/>
&ldquo;And puzzle their brains to find out any other.&rdquo;<br/>
Indeed &rsquo;tis most strange and surprising to me<br/>
That all folks in <i>rhiming</i> their int&rsquo;rest can&rsquo;t see;<br/>
For I&rsquo;m sure if its use were quite common with men,<br/>
The world would roll on just as pleasant again.<br/>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis said, that while O<small>RPHEUS</small> was striking his lyre,<br/>
&ldquo;Trees and brutes danc&rsquo;d along to the sound of the wire;<br/>
&ldquo;That A<small>MPHION</small> to walls soon converted the glebes,<br/>
&ldquo;And they rose, as he sung, to a city call&rsquo;d Thebes;<br/>
&ldquo;I suppose <i>they</i> were <i>Butlers</i> (like me) of that time,<br/>
&ldquo;And the tale shows our sires knew the wonders of
<i>rhime</i>.&rdquo;<br/>
From time immemorial, your lovers, we find,<br/>
When their mistresses&rsquo; hearts have been proud and unkind,<br/>
Have resorted to <i>rhime</i>; and indeed it appears<br/>
That a <i>rhime</i> would do more than a bucket of tears.<br/>
Of love, from experience, I speak&mdash;odds my life!<br/>
I shall never forget how I courted my wife:<br/>
She had offers in plenty; but always stood neuter,<br/>
Till I, with my pen, started forth as a suitor;<br/>
Yet I made no mean present of <i>ribband</i> or <i>bonnet</i>,<br/>
<i>My</i> present was caught from the stars&mdash;&rsquo;twas a
<i>sonnet</i>.<br/>
&ldquo;And now you know this, sure &rsquo;tis needless to say,<br/>
&ldquo;That prose was neglected, and <i>rhime</i> won the day&mdash;<br/>
&ldquo;But its potent effects you as well may discover<br/>
&ldquo;In the <i>husband</i> and <i>wife</i>, as in <i>mistress</i> and
<i>lover</i>;<br/>
&ldquo;There are some of ye here, who, like me, I conjecture.<br/>
&ldquo;Have been lull&rsquo;d into sleep by a good <i>curtain lecture</i>.<br/>
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a mere trifle; you&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er come to
blows,<br/>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll only avoid that dull enemy, <i>prose</i>.<br/>
&ldquo;Adopt, then, my plan, and the very next time,<br/>
&ldquo;That in words you fall out, let them fall into <i>rhime</i>;<br/>
&ldquo;Thus your sharpest disputes will conclude very soon,<br/>
&ldquo;And from jangling to jingling you&rsquo;ll chime into <i>tune</i>.<br/>
&ldquo;If my wife were to call me a <i>drunken old sot</i>,<br/>
&ldquo;I shou&rsquo;d merely just ask her, what Butler is not?<br/>
&ldquo;And bid her take care that she don&rsquo;t go to pot.<br/>
&ldquo;So our squabbles continue a very short season,<br/>
&ldquo;If she yields to my <i>rhime</i>&mdash;I allow she has
reason.&rdquo;<br/>
Independent of this I conceive <i>rhime</i> has weight<br/>
In the higher employments of church and of state,<br/>
And would in my mind such advantages draw,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis a pity that <i>rhime</i> is not sanctioned by law;<br/>
&ldquo;For &rsquo;twould <i>really</i> be serving us all, to impose<br/>
&ldquo;A capital fine on a man who spoke prose.&rdquo;<br/>
Mark the pleader who clacks, in his client&rsquo;s behalf,<br/>
His technical stuff for three hours and a half;<br/>
Or the fellow who tells you a long stupid story,<br/>
And over and over the same lays before ye;<br/>
Or the member who raves till the whole house are dosing<br/>
What d&rsquo;ye say of such men? Why you say they are prosing.<br/>
So, of course, then, if <i>prose</i> is so tedious a <i>crime</i>,<br/>
It of consequence follows, there&rsquo;s <i>virtue</i> in <i>rhime</i>.<br/>
The best piece of prose that I&rsquo;ve heard a long while,<br/>
Is what gallant Nelson has sent from <small>THE</small> N<small>ILE</small>.<br/>
And had he but told us the story in <i>rhime</i>,<br/>
What a thing &rsquo;twou&rsquo;d be; but, perhaps, he&rsquo;d no time.<br/>
So, I&rsquo;ll do it myself&mdash;Oh! &rsquo;tis glorious news!<br/>
Nine <i>sail</i> of the line! Just a ship for each Muse.<br/>
As I live, there&rsquo;s an end of the French and their navy&mdash;<br/>
Sir John Warren has sent the Brest fleet to Old Davy.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis in the Gazette, and that, every one knows,<br/>
Is sure to be truth, tho&rsquo; &rsquo;tis written in prose.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
